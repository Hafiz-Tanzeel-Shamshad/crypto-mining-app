      question: " What are Kinzoo Energy Points?",
      answer: "Kinzoo Energy Points are loyalty and mining rewards earned by early supporters of the Kinzoo Protocol. They represent your activity and contribution before our token launch."
    },
    {
      question: " Will Kinzoo Energy Points convert into $KINZ tokens?",
      answer: "Yes! All Kinzoo Energy Points will be convertible into $KINZ tokens at TGE (Token Generation Event). The more Energy Points you earn, the more $KINZ you'll be able to claim."
    },
    {
      question: " What is the conversion ratio from Energy Points to $KINZ?",
      answer: "The conversion ratio will be officially announced before the TGE. It will be designed to fairly reward early contributors and miners."
    },
    {
      question: " Can I create multiple accounts to earn more points?",
      answer: "No. Multi-accounting, bot activity, or any form of cheating is strictly prohibited. Offenders will be suspended permanently and forfeit all Energy Points."
    },
    {
      question: " Is there a minimum amount of Energy Points required to participate in TGE?",
      answer: "No minimum required. Whether you've earned a little or a lot, every valid Energy Point counts and will be convertible at TGE."
    },
    {
      question: " When is the TGE?",
      answer: "The official date will be announced soon. Stay tuned on our socials and Discord for updates."
